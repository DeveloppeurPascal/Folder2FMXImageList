# Folder to FMX Image List

[Cette page en fran√ßais.](LISEZMOI.md)

Create a FireMonkey TImageList by importing all images in a folder.

This code repository contains a project developed in Object Pascal language under Delphi. You don't know what Delphi is and where to download it ? You'll learn more [on this web site](https://delphi-resources.developpeur-pascal.fr/).

### How to use Folder2FMXImageList ?

* Specify the folder path were are your images.

* Choose your export method (clipboard or TDataModule unit).

* In case you choosed the clipboard, just paste the result to Delphi form editor on a TForm, TFrame or (better choice) TDataModule in a FireMonkey Project.

* In case you choosed TDataModule unit export, just include it to a FireMonkey project like you does with any other unit.

* You can drag & drop folders to the source directory path to export each of them as a TDataModule unit.

### What does Folder2FMXImageList ?

The program searches all PNG files in a folder and its subfolders.

It creates a TImageList and adds the files as "Source". Each file is imported as it, with scale 1 if no scale is specified in its name.

After filling the TImageList.Source property, the program creates a Destination for each Source image.

Then, depending on your export method, the program serialize the TImageList and copy it to the clipboard or generate a TDataModule unit and save it on disk in the images folder.

### File name and scale

I based the file name split on [Adobe Illustrator](https://vasur.fr/illustrator) default export format :

![Adobe Illustrator homothetic export sample](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Folder2FMXImageList/raw/main/screen-captures/04-FilesForHomotheticExport.png)

xxx.png will create a source named "xxx" with scale 1
xxx@3x.png will create a source named "xxx" with scale 3
xxx@1.5x.png will create a source named "xxx" with scale 1,5

The program don't verify bitmap sizes. If the scale is not the good one, this will impact the display of bitmaps in your programs.

### Possible errors

If you have the same image filename in multiple subfolders of the path you specified during the same import, it will raise an exception.

## Source code installation

To download this code repository, we recommend using "git", but you can also download a ZIP file directly from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Folder2FMXImageList).

This project uses dependencies in the form of sub-modules. They will be absent from the ZIP file. You'll have to download them by hand.

* [DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component) must be installed in the ./lib-externes/AboutDialog-Delphi-Component subfolder.
* [DeveloppeurPascal/librairies](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/librairies) must be installed in the ./lib-externes/librairies subfolder.

## Compatibility

As an [Embarcadero MVP](https://www.embarcadero.com/resources/partners/mvp-directory), I benefit from the latest versions of [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi) and [C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) in [RAD Studio](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/rad-studio) as soon as they are released. I therefore work with these versions.

Normally, my libraries and components should also run on at least the current version of [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter).

There's no guarantee of compatibility with earlier versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many of the new ways of writing in it (type inference, inline var and multiline strings).

If you detect any anomalies on earlier versions, please don't hesitate to [report them](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Folder2FMXImageList/issues) so that I can test and try to correct or provide a workaround.
